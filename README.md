# Description
This project was my submission to the semester project for my first semester at Noroff University.

The project consists of: 
- A landing page for the museum
- A exhibitions page showing special events and exhibitions at the museum
- A page about how to get involved with the museum
- A contact page for the museum
- A page with visitor info
- A page for terms & conditions
- A page for privacy policy
